## Features

Composer.vim provides conveniences for working with Composer PHP projects.
Some features include:

* `:Composer` command wrapper around `composer` with smart completion
* Navigate to source files using Composer's autoloader
* Insert `use` statement for the class/interface/trait under cursor
* [Projectionist][projectionist] support (e.g., `:Ecomposer` to edit your
  `composer.json`, `:A` to jump to `composer.lock` and back)
* [Dispatch][dispatch] support (`:Dispatch` runs `composer dump-autoload`)

See `:help composer` for details.

## Installation and Requirements

Using vim-plug, for example:

	Plug 'noahfrederick/vim-composer'

Optionally install [Dispatch.vim][dispatch] and
[Projectionist.vim][projectionist] for projections and asynchronous command
execution:

	Plug 'tpope/vim-dispatch'
	Plug 'tpope/vim-projectionist'

**Note**: either Projectionist.vim or Vim version 7.4.1304 or later is required
for JSON support.
